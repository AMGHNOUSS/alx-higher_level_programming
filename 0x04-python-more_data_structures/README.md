Requirements
------------

### General

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

Tasks
-----

### 0\. Squared simple

mandatory

Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
-   Prototype: `def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):`
-   `matrix` is a 2 dimensional array
-   Returns a new matrix:
    -   Same size as `matrix`
    -   Each value should be the square of the value of the input
-   Initial matrix should not be modified
-   You are not allowed to import any module
-   You are allowed to use regular loops, `map`, etc.

```
ume@ubuntu:~/0x04$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
square_matrix_simple = __import__('0-square_matrix_simple').square_matrix_simple

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

new_matrix = square_matrix_simple(matrix)
print(new_matrix)
print(matrix)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x04$ ./0-main.py
[[1, 4, 9], [16, 25, 36], [49, 64, 81]]
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
